The camera interface in Photo Scanner is designed to be simple yet powerful. It includes:

1. **Camera Preview**: Shows the live view from your camera
2. **Capture Button**: Takes a photo
3. **Process Image Button**: Opens the gallery to view and process captured images
4. **Version Display**: Shows the current app version
5. **Menu Icon**: Opens the navigation drawer for additional options

## Preparing to Take Photos

For the best results when scanning photos or documents:

1. **Lighting**: Use even, diffused lighting to avoid glare and shadows
   - Natural daylight is often best
   - Avoid direct sunlight, which can cause harsh shadows and overexposure
   - Avoid using flash in reflective surfaces

2. **Surface**: Place documents on a flat, contrasting background
   - Use a dark background for light-colored documents
   - Use a light background for dark-colored documents
   - Avoid patterns or textured surfaces that might interfere with edge detection

3. **Stability**: Ensure your device is stable
   - Hold your device parallel to the document
   - Use both hands for stability
   - Consider using a tripod for consistent results

4. **Framing**: Position the document to fill the frame
   - Leave a small margin around the edges
   - Ensure the entire document is visible in the preview
   - Make sure the document is not cut off at any edge

## Taking a Single Photo

1. Launch Photo Scanner
2. Hold your device above the document you want to capture
3. Press the "Start Camera" button to initialize the camera
   - Wait for the camera to focus on the document
   - Adjust your position if needed to get a clear view
4. When ready, press the "Capture" button to take the photo
5. The app will automatically process and save the image
## Adjusting Resolution

Photo Scanner allows you to choose different resolution settings based on your needs:

1. Open the navigation drawer by tapping the menu icon (☰)
2. Tap "Resolution"
3. Select your preferred resolution:
   - **High**: Maximum quality (original camera resolution)
   - **Medium**: Balanced quality and file size (1280 × 960 pixels)
   - **Low**: Smaller file size (640 × 480 pixels)
4. Tap the resolution you want to use
5. The app will confirm your selection and use this resolution for future captures

## Tips for Better Photos

- **Hold Steady**: Any movement can cause blur. Take a moment to stabilize your device before capturing.
- **Check Lighting**: If you see glare or shadows, adjust your position or the lighting.
- **Use the Grid**: Enable the camera grid in your device settings to help align documents.
- **Keep the Lens Clean**: A smudged camera lens can reduce photo quality significantly.
- **Capture in Landscape**: For wide documents, hold your device in landscape orientation.
- **Multiple Attempts**: Take several photos of important documents to ensure you get a good capture.

## Battery-Saving Mode

Photo Scanner includes a battery-saving camera mode that automatically shuts down the camera after capturing a photo to conserve battery power. This is especially useful during long scanning sessions.

The camera will initialize again when you press the "Start Camera" button for your next capture.

## Next Steps

After capturing photos, you'll typically want to:

- [Process your images](processing-images.md) to enhance quality
- [Organize your files](file-naming.md) with custom naming templates
- [View and manage metadata](metadata.md) for your captured images
