# Photo Scanner v1.4 - Batch Scanning Removal Process

I've successfully completed the removal of the Batch Scanning feature from the Photo Scanner app. Here's a summary of the work performed:

## 1. Documentation Updates
- Removed "Integrated batch scanning components" from the v1.4 section in README.md
- Removed all batch scanning references from v1.4-release-notes.md
- Updated status.md to remove the batch scanning integration section

## 2. UI and Resource Updates
- Removed all batch-related string resources from strings.xml
- Removed the batch control panel section from activity_main.xml
- Updated layout constraints to maintain UI integrity after removing batch controls
- Updated version text from "v1.3" to "v1.4" in the layout

## 3. Code Updates
- Removed all batch-related methods and variables from MainActivity.java:
  - Removed setupBatchModeControls() method
  - Removed batch-related instance variables
  - Removed updateBatchCounterUI() method
  - Removed references to setupBatchModeControls() in onCreate()

## 4. Build Configuration Updates
- Updated app/build.gradle to exclude batch-related Java files from compilation
- Updated comment to remove reference to batch scanning

## 5. Technical Challenges Addressed
- Solved compilation errors by moving batch-related layout files out of the res directory
- Created a disabled_resources directory to store the batch-related layout files
- Maintained exclusion of batch-related Java files through build.gradle

## 6. Verification
- Successfully built the app with ./gradlew clean build
- Confirmed the absence of batch scanning references in active codebase:
  - No batch references in MainActivity.java
  - No batch references in layout files
  - No batch references in strings.xml

## Results
- Photo Scanner v1.4 builds successfully without any batch scanning functionality
- All user-facing references to batch scanning have been removed
- Source code for batch scanning classes has been preserved but excluded from compilation, allowing for potential future reintroduction of the feature

The app is now ready for v1.4 development with the batch scanning feature completely removed as requested.
