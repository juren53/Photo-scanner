# Summary of Changes to Remove Batch Scanning

All necessary changes have been completed to remove references to Batch Scanning from the Photo Scanner app as requested. Here's a summary of the changes made:

## 1. Documentation Updates

### README.md
- Removed "Integrated batch scanning components" from the v1.4 section

### v1.4-release-notes.md
- Removed "Batch Scanning" from New Features section
- Removed "Integrated batch mode UI components" from UI Improvements section
- Removed "Integrated BatchScanManager with the MainActivity" from Technical Improvements section
- Removed "Improved error handling with batch operations" from Bug Fixes section

### status.md
- Removed "Integrate the batch scanning components" section from "In Progress (v1.4)"
- Updated the Implementation Notes paragraph to remove reference to batch scanning components

## 2. UI Updates

### app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml
- Removed the entire Batch Control Panel (LinearLayout with id="batchControlPanel")
- Updated the constraint for the PreviewView (viewFinder) to point to buttonPanel instead of batchControlPanel
- Updated version text from "v1.3" to "v1.4"

### app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml
- Removed all batch-related string resources:
  - photo_added_to_batch
  - batch_empty
  - finish_batch
  - batch_mode
  - batch_counter
  - review_batch
  - batch_mode_description
  - continue_batch

## 3. Build Configuration Updates

### app/build.gradle
- Updated the comment from "Exclude edge detection and batch scanning files" to just "Exclude edge detection files"
- Kept the exclusions for BatchReviewActivity.java and BatchScanManager.java since we want to exclude these files from the build

## Note on Source Code

The Java source files for batch scanning (BatchReviewActivity.java and BatchScanManager.java) are still in the codebase but are excluded from compilation via the build.gradle configuration. This allows for easier reintroduction of the feature in the future if needed, without requiring immediate deletion of the source code.

These changes ensure that all user-facing references to Batch Scanning have been removed from the application, making it clear that this feature is not available in v1.4.
