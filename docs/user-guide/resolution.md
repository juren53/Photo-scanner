This guide explains how to use Photo Scanner's resolution settings to optimize image quality and storage usage for your scanned photos.

## Introduction to Resolution Settings

Resolution is a critical factor in determining the quality, detail, and file size of your scanned photos. Photo Scanner gives you control over image resolution to help you balance quality against storage space and processing speed.

The resolution setting determines:

- How much detail is captured in your scanned photos
- How large the resulting image files will be on your device
- How quickly photos can be processed and saved
- How suitable the images will be for different uses (viewing, printing, archiving)

Choosing the right resolution for your needs ensures you get the optimal balance between image quality and efficient use of your device's resources.

## Available Resolution Options

Photo Scanner offers three resolution settings:

### High Resolution

- **Description**: Original camera resolution (your device's maximum capability)
- **Use case**: For maximum quality and detail
- **Pixel dimensions**: Depends on your device's camera (typically 3000×4000 pixels or higher)
- **Advantage**: Captures the finest details and allows for extensive cropping or enlargement
- **Disadvantage**: Creates large files that consume more storage space

### Medium Resolution (Default)

- **Description**: Balanced quality and file size
- **Use case**: For everyday scanning with good detail
- **Pixel dimensions**: 1280×960 pixels
- **Advantage**: Good visual quality while using reasonable storage space
- **Disadvantage**: Less detail than high resolution if you need to heavily crop or enlarge

### Low Resolution

- **Description**: Space-saving option with reduced detail
- **Use case**: For quick reference scans or when storage space is limited
- **Pixel dimensions**: 640×480 pixels
- **Advantage**: Very small file sizes, faster processing
- **Disadvantage**: Limited detail and not suitable for printing or enlargement

## Accessing Resolution Settings

To change the resolution setting:

1. Launch Photo Scanner
2. Open the navigation drawer by tapping the menu icon (☰) in the top-left corner
3. Tap "Resolution"
4. The Resolution Settings dialog will appear
5. Select your preferred resolution (High, Medium, or Low)
6. Tap "OK" to apply the setting

Your chosen resolution will be applied to all future photos you capture until you change the setting again. The app remembers your preference between sessions.

## Choosing the Right Resolution

Different scanning scenarios call for different resolution settings. Here's a guide to help you choose:

### When to Use High Resolution

- **Important family photos** you want to preserve with maximum detail
- **Historical documents** with fine print or intricate details
- **Photos you plan to print** at larger sizes
- **Images that may need significant cropping**
- **Archival purposes** where preserving every detail matters
- **When you have plenty of storage space** available

### When to Use Medium Resolution

- **Most everyday photos** for general use
- **Documents with normal-sized text**
- **Photos for digital sharing** or viewing on screens
- **When balancing quality and storage** is important
- **For faster processing** while maintaining good quality

### When to Use Low Resolution

- **Quick reference scans** where detail isn't critical
- **Simple text documents** without fine print
- **When storage space is very limited**
- **Temporary scans** you don't need to keep long-term
- **When scanning very large quantities** where storage is a concern
- **For creating small thumbnail images** or web previews

## How Resolution Affects Your Scans

### Storage Impact

Resolution has a direct impact on file size:

| Resolution | Approximate File Size | Photos per 1GB |
|------------|----------------------|----------------|
| High       | 2-5 MB (varies by device) | 200-500      |
| Medium     | 300-500 KB           | 2,000-3,000    |
| Low        | 60-100 KB            | 10,000+        |

*Note: Actual file sizes may vary based on image content and compression.*

### Quality Impact

The resolution setting affects different types of content in different ways:

- **Text Documents**:
  - High: Even the smallest text is clear and readable
  - Medium: Most text is readable, very small text may be slightly blurry
  - Low: Only larger text remains clearly readable

- **Photos with Fine Details**:
  - High: All fine details visible (hair, fabric texture, distant objects)
  - Medium: Most details visible, some very fine details may be lost
  - Low: Only major details are preserved, fine details are lost

- **Photos for Enlargement**:
  - High: Can be enlarged significantly without pixelation
  - Medium: Limited enlargement possible before quality degrades
  - Low: Minimal enlargement possible, quickly becomes pixelated

### Processing Speed

Lower resolutions process faster:
- High resolution photos may take 1-3 seconds to process and save
- Medium resolution photos typically process in under a second
- Low resolution photos process almost instantly

This difference becomes significant when processing multiple photos.
## Technical Details

Photo Scanner processes images differently based on the selected resolution:

### High Resolution

- Uses your device camera's native resolution
- No downsampling is applied to the captured image
- Preserves the original quality from your camera sensor
- File sizes vary based on your device's camera capabilities

### Medium Resolution (1280×960)

- Captured image is resized to 1280×960 pixels
- Aspect ratio is preserved during resizing
- Balances detail preservation with file size reduction
- Approximately 1/4 the file size of a typical high-resolution image

### Low Resolution (640×480)

- Captured image is resized to 640×480 pixels
- Aspect ratio is preserved during resizing
- Prioritizes file size reduction over detail preservation
- Approximately 1/16 the file size of a typical high-resolution image

## Resolution and Device Considerations

### Storage Capacity

- **Limited Storage Devices**: If your device has limited storage, consider using medium or low resolution
- **High-Capacity Devices**: With 64GB+ of storage, you can comfortably use high resolution for important scans

### Display Quality

- Modern high-resolution phone displays benefit from high-resolution scans
- On older devices with lower resolution screens, the visual difference between high and medium may be less noticeable

### Camera Quality

- The benefits of high resolution depend on your device's camera quality
- Premium smartphones with high-quality cameras show more significant differences between resolution settings

## Tips for Optimal Resolution Usage

- **Mix and Match**: Use different resolutions for different types of content rather than a one-size-fits-all approach
- **Test First**: Take test scans at different resolutions to see the quality difference on your specific device
- **Consider End Use**: Think about how you'll ultimately use the scanned image when choosing resolution
- **Check Results**: Always review your first few scans at a new resolution setting to ensure they meet your needs
- **Storage Management**: Periodically transfer high-resolution scans to cloud storage or your computer
- **Save Originals**: For important documents or photos, consider using high resolution even if it takes more space
- **Batch Processing**: When scanning many similar items, choose a consistent resolution for the entire batch

## Changing Resolution Mid-Project

You can change resolution settings at any time:

1. If you're in the middle of a scanning session, complete your current photo
2. Access the resolution settings as described above
3. Select your new preferred resolution
4. Continue scanning with the new setting

Note that changing resolution only affects new photos. Previously captured photos retain their original resolution.
## Next Steps

After configuring your resolution settings, you might want to explore:

- [File Naming Templates](file-naming.md) for organizing your scanned photos
- [Viewing and Managing Photos](viewing-managing.md) to review your collection
