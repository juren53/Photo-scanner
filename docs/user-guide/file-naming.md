This guide explains how to use Photo Scanner's file naming template system to create organized, consistent filenames for your scanned photos.

## Introduction to File Naming Templates

When digitizing a collection of photos or documents, having a consistent naming system is crucial for organization and searchability. Photo Scanner's file naming template feature allows you to:

- Create custom base names for your files
- Automatically add sequential numbering to each photo
- Maintain naming consistency across scanning sessions
- Group related photos together in file listings
- Make your digital collection easier to browse and search

Rather than accepting generic camera-generated filenames like "IMG_20250421_123456.jpg," you can create meaningful names like "FamilyVacation_001.jpg" that instantly identify the content and maintain proper sequence.

## Accessing Naming Settings

To configure your file naming template:

1. Launch Photo Scanner
2. Open the navigation drawer by tapping the menu icon (â˜°) in the top-left corner
3. Tap "File Naming Template"
4. The File Naming Template dialog will appear

## Configuring Your Naming Template

The File Naming Template dialog contains two main settings:

### Template Name

1. In the "Name Template" field, enter the base text you want to use for your filenames
2. This can be any text that helps identify the photo category (e.g., "FamilyPhotos", "Documents", "Trip2025")
3. Avoid using special characters that might cause problems in filenames (such as `/`, `\`, `:`, `*`, `?`, `"`, `<`, `>`, `|`)
4. As you type, the preview will update to show how your filenames will appear

### Counter Number

1. In the "Starting Number" field, enter the number you want to start counting from (typically 1)
2. This counter will automatically increment each time you take a photo
3. The app will format the counter with leading zeros (e.g., 001, 002, etc.)
4. As you change the number, the preview will update to show the result

## How the Counter System Works

Photo Scanner's counter system works as follows:

1. **Automatic Incrementing**: Every time you take a photo, the counter increases by 1
2. **Persistent Counter**: The counter value is saved between app sessions
3. **Formatting with Leading Zeros**:
   - Numbers 1-9 appear as "001", "002", etc.
   - Numbers 10-99 appear as "010", "020", etc.
   - Numbers 100-999 appear as "100", "200", etc.
4. **Counter Combination**: The app combines your template with the counter using an underscore, followed by the file extension (e.g., "Vacation_001.jpg")

The counter continues to increment as long as you use the app, unless you manually reset it by changing the starting number.

## Example Naming Templates

Here are some effective naming templates for different scenarios:

### Family Photos

- **Template**: "Family_Reunion"
- **Result**: Family_Reunion_001.jpg, Family_Reunion_002.jpg, etc.
- **Best for**: Events where all photos belong to the same occasion

### Document Archives

- **Template**: "Receipt"
- **Result**: Receipt_001.jpg, Receipt_002.jpg, etc.
- **Best for**: Business documents that need sequential tracking

### Photo Albums

- **Template**: "Album1960s"
- **Result**: Album1960s_001.jpg, Album1960s_002.jpg, etc.
- **Best for**: Digitizing photos from a specific time period

### Mixed Content

- **Template**: "Scan"
- **Result**: Scan_001.jpg, Scan_002.jpg, etc.
- **Best for**: General purpose scanning of varied content

### Date-Based Naming

- **Template**: "20250421"
- **Result**: 20250421_001.jpg, 20250421_002.jpg, etc.
- **Best for**: Organizing photos primarily by date
## Organizing Through Naming Conventions

Strategic use of naming templates can significantly improve your photo organization:

### Hierarchical Naming

Create a hierarchical system using template prefixes:
- **Family_Wedding_Smith**: For the Smith family wedding photos
- **Family_Wedding_Johnson**: For the Johnson family wedding photos
- **Family_Vacation_2025**: For the 2025 vacation photos

### Project-Based Naming

Organize by projects or purposes:
- **Project_Genealogy**: For family history research photos
- **Project_HomeRenovation**: For before/after renovation photos
- **Project_Inventory**: For cataloging household items

### Date-Integrated Naming

Include dates in your templates:
- **2025_04_Birthday**: For birthday photos in April 2025
- **2025_Summer_Vacation**: For summer 2025 vacation photos

## Tips for Effective File Naming

- **Be Consistent**: Once you establish a naming convention, stick with it
- **Keep It Simple**: Avoid overly complex naming templates
- **Use Underscores** or camelCase instead of spaces in your templates
- **Be Descriptive**: Choose names that will make sense months or years later
- **Reset Counters Thoughtfully**: Only reset when starting a genuinely new sequence
- **Plan Ahead**: Think about how you'll search for these photos later
- **Consider File Systems**: Some systems have character or length limitations
- **Avoid Special Characters**: Stick to letters, numbers, and underscores

## Limitations and Considerations

When using Photo Scanner's file naming system, be aware of these limitations:

- **Maximum Length**: Very long naming templates may be truncated in some file systems
- **Character Restrictions**: The app prevents you from using invalid filename characters, but may not catch all problematic characters for all systems
- **Counter Limit**: The counter system is designed for up to 999 photos (beyond that, the formatting will adjust)
- **Sorting Behavior**: How files sort in file browsers depends on the naming convention you choose
- **Template Sharing**: Templates and counters are device-specific and not synchronized across devices

## Changing Templates Mid-Project

If you need to change your naming template in the middle of a project:

1. Consider how this will affect file sorting and organization
2. You may want to create a new directory or album for the new naming scheme
3. Document your naming change for future reference
4. Consider batch renaming previously captured photos to maintain consistency (using desktop software)

## Next Steps

After setting up your file naming template, you might want to explore:

- [Viewing and Managing Photos](viewing-managing.md) to organize your collection
- [Metadata Management](metadata.md) to add more information to your photos
