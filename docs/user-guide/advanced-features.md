This section covers the more sophisticated capabilities of Photo Scanner that help power users digitize and manage their photo collections more efficiently.

## Introduction to Advanced Features

While Photo Scanner is designed to be simple enough for anyone to use, it also includes several advanced features that provide greater control, efficiency, and organization. These features are especially valuable when:

- Digitizing large collections of photos
- Working with photos that require consistent naming
- Managing limited storage space on your device
- Needing to track and preserve photo metadata

## Available Advanced Features

Photo Scanner offers three main advanced features that extend the app's capabilities:

### File Naming Templates

The file naming template system lets you create consistent, meaningful filenames automatically for all your scanned photos.

**Key capabilities:**
- Custom text templates for file names
- Automatic sequential numbering
- Real-time filename preview
- Persistent settings between app sessions

### Resolution Settings

Resolution settings allow you to control the quality and file size of your scanned images to balance detail and storage space.

**Key capabilities:**
- Three quality levels: High, Medium, and Low
- Original camera resolution for maximum quality
- Optimized medium resolution (1280 × 960 pixels)
- Space-saving low resolution (640 × 480 pixels)

### Metadata Management

The metadata management features help you view, interpret, and (in future versions) edit the technical information associated with your photos.

**Key capabilities:**
- EXIF metadata extraction and display
- IPTC metadata support
- GPS coordinate interpretation
- Detailed technical information
- File and image specifications

## When to Use Advanced Features

### File Naming Templates

Use file naming templates when you want to:
- Organize photos by collection or project
- Create a consistent naming scheme
- Avoid duplicate filenames
- Make it easy to find specific photos later
- Group related photos together in file listings

### Resolution Settings

Adjust resolution settings when you need to:
- Maximize quality for important photos
- Save storage space for less critical items
- Balance quality and quantity for large collections
- Optimize images for specific uses (web, printing, archiving)

### Metadata Management

Use metadata features when you want to:
- Identify when and where photos were taken
- View technical details about the capture process
- Preserve information about the original physical photos
- Search and organize your collection by technical criteria

## Combining Advanced Features
For maximum efficiency, Photo Scanner's advanced features work well together:

1. **Complete Workflow Example:**
   - Set up a naming template for your current project (e.g., "FamilyAlbum_")
   - Choose an appropriate resolution for the content
   - Take photos with consistent settings
   - Review metadata to organize by date or camera settings

2. **Memory Books Workflow:**
   - Create a naming template for the specific event (e.g., "Vacation2023_")
   - Use high resolution for these important memories
   - Capture photos with careful framing and lighting
   - Review metadata to help with chronological ordering

3. **Document Archiving Workflow:**
   - Set a naming template for the document type (e.g., "Receipt_")
   - Use medium or low resolution to save space
   - Capture documents with consistent positioning
   - Use metadata to track capture dates

## Tips for Advanced Users

- **Prepare Before Scanning**: Set up your naming templates and resolution settings before starting a large scanning session
- **Create Project-Specific Templates**: Use different naming templates for different types of materials
- **Reset Counter Strategically**: Reset the naming counter when starting a new logical group of photos
- **Balance Quality and Space**: Choose resolution based on the content's importance and detail level
- **Verify First Few Scans**: After starting a batch scan, check the first few results to ensure quality before proceeding
- **Organize by Collections**: Create a system where different naming templates indicate different collections
- **Use Battery-Saving Mode**: For long scanning sessions, enable the battery-saving camera mode
- **Back Up Regularly**: Export your scanned photos to a computer or cloud storage frequently

## Accessing Advanced Features

All advanced features are accessible through the navigation drawer menu:

1. Tap the menu icon (☰) in the top-left corner of the main screen
2. Select the desired advanced feature:
   - "File Naming Template" for naming options
   - "Resolution" for quality settings
   - "Meta-tags" for metadata viewing
   - (Batch scanning is enabled through a toggle switch in the main interface)

## Future Advanced Features

Photo Scanner is continuously evolving. Future versions plan to include:
- Advanced edge detection and perspective correction
- OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for text in photos
- Cloud backup integration
- Multi-page document creation
- Custom metadata tagging
