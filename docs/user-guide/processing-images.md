## Processing Modes

Photo Scanner offers two processing modes:

### Automatic Mode

- **When to use**: For quick enhancements when you're processing many photos
- **How it works**: The app analyzes the image and applies optimal settings
- **Advantages**: Fast, consistent results with minimal effort

### Manual Mode

- **When to use**: For fine-tuning important photos or when automatic results aren't satisfactory
- **How it works**: You control every aspect of the processing through individual adjustments
- **Advantages**: Complete control over the final appearance

To switch between modes, tap the "Auto/Manual" toggle in the processing interface.

## Saving Processed Images

After processing, you have several options for saving your images:

1. **Save**: Overwrites the original image with your processed version
2. **Save As**: Creates a new copy, preserving the original
3. **Export**: Saves in different formats or quality levels

To access these options, tap the "Save" button after processing and select your preferred method.

## Tips for Best Results

- **Even Lighting**: Process images taken under even lighting for better results
- **Start with Auto**: Begin with automatic enhancement, then apply manual adjustments if needed
- **Subtle Changes**: Make small, incremental adjustments rather than dramatic changes
- **Compare Versions**: Use the "Before/After" view to compare your changes with the original
- **Batch Similar Photos**: Group similar photos for batch processing to maintain consistency
- **Save Originals**: Use "Save As" to preserve your original images

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Colors look unnatural after enhancement | Reduce saturation or try manual adjustments instead of auto-enhance |
| Edge detection not working properly | Make sure the document has clear contrast with the background and try again in better lighting |
| Processed image appears blurry | Adjust the sharpness setting or ensure the original capture was in focus |
| App slows down during processing | Larger images require more processing power; try using a lower resolution setting for future captures |

## Next Steps

After processing your images, you may want to:

- [Manage your photo collection](viewing-managing.md)
- [Add metadata](metadata.md) to your processed images
- [Set up file naming templates](file-naming.md) for better organization

For more advanced processing needs, consider using specialized desktop software after exporting your images from Photo Scanner.
