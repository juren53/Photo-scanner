# Photo Scanner App - Development Status

## Completed Features (v1.3)

- Implemented navigation drawer with hamburger menu
- Added About, Help, and Settings dialogs
- Implemented resolution selection feature (high, medium, low)
- Added image statistics activity with detailed EXIF data display
- Implemented photo metadata viewing capability
- Improved UI with Material Design components and dark mode support
- Fixed compilation issues (ListenableFuture import, GPS coordinates extraction)
- Created proper build system with signing configuration for release builds
- Added custom file naming system with templates and sequential numbering
- Implemented persistent naming preferences between sessions
- Added real-time filename preview in the rename dialog

## On Hold Features (For Future Versions)

- Enhanced edge detection with improved algorithms (complete in EdgeDetectionUtils)
- Added support for difficult lighting conditions in document scanning

## Current Challenges

- The Edit feature in the navigation drawer is currently a placeholder
- Metadata viewing is read-only; editing capability is needed
- Needs optimization for larger image collections
- Need to implement full IPTC metadata support beyond basic EXIF data
- Optimizing performance for larger image collections

## In Progress (v1.4)

1. Implement the Edit feature for basic photo editing capabilities:
   - Rotation, cropping, and basic adjustments
   - Add filters and enhancement options
   - Save edited copies with version tracking

2. Implement metadata editing:
   - Add IPTC metadata editing capabilities using third-party libraries
   - Create custom metadata tags system
   - Add the ability to save metadata changes back to images

4. Add organization/categorization features:
   - Folder management
   - Tagging and search functionality
   - Export/import functionality

## Build System

- Added release signing configuration in app/build.gradle
- Created keystore for signing release builds
- Configured lintOptions to handle excluded files
- Documented build process in build-instructions.md
- Set up proper versioning system for APK files

## Implementation Notes

The main structure of MainActivity has been significantly improved in v1.3 with proper organization and removal of duplicated code. The custom file naming system enhances user experience by allowing sequential naming of scanned photos. The app is now ready for distribution with properly signed release builds.
