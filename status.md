# Photo Scanner App - Development Status

## Completed Features (v1.1)

- Implemented navigation drawer with hamburger menu
- Added About, Help, and Settings dialogs
- Implemented resolution selection feature (high, medium, low)
- Added image statistics activity with detailed EXIF data display
- Implemented photo metadata viewing capability
- Improved UI with Material Design components and dark mode support
- Fixed compilation issues (ListenableFuture import, GPS coordinates extraction)
- Created proper build system with signing configuration for release builds

## Batch Scanning Architecture (Ready for Integration)

- Enhanced edge detection with improved algorithms (complete in EdgeDetectionUtils)
- Added support for difficult lighting conditions in document scanning
- Completed batch scanning components:
  - Created BatchScanManager for managing batches of scanned images
  - Created BatchReviewActivity for reviewing and managing batches
  - Added UI elements and layouts for batch mode
  - Added dialog for continuing batch scanning after processing

## Current Challenges

- The Edit feature in the navigation drawer is currently a placeholder
- Metadata viewing is read-only; editing capability is needed
- BatchScanManager needs to be integrated with the updated MainActivity
- Need to implement full IPTC metadata support beyond basic EXIF data
- Optimizing performance for larger image collections

## Recommended Next Steps (v1.2)

1. Implement the Edit feature for basic photo editing capabilities:
   - Rotation, cropping, and basic adjustments
   - Add filters and enhancement options
   - Save edited copies with version tracking

2. Integrate the batch scanning components:
   - Connect batch mode UI components to BatchScanManager
   - Update photo capture flow to support batch scanning
   - Add proper lifecycle handling for batch operations

3. Implement metadata editing:
   - Add IPTC metadata editing capabilities
   - Create custom metadata tags system
   - Add the ability to save metadata changes back to images

4. Add organization/categorization features:
   - Folder management
   - Tagging and search functionality
   - Export/import functionality

## Build System Improvements

- Added release signing configuration in app/build.gradle
- Created keystore for signing release builds
- Configured lintOptions to handle excluded files
- Documented build process in build-instructions.md
- Set up proper versioning system for APK files

## Implementation Notes

The main structure of MainActivity has been significantly improved in v1.1 with proper organization and removal of duplicated code. The batch scanning components are complete and functional but need to be integrated. The app is now ready for distribution with properly signed release builds.
